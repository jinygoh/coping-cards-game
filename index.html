            <p>Coping Cards is a game that helps you practice your coping skills. On each turn, a player will draw a card with a difficult situation. All players will then share how they would cope with the situation. The players will then vote on whose coping mechanism was the best, and the winner of the round gets a point. The first player to 10 points wins!</p>
